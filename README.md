# MLOps

What is MLOps?<br>
Answer:-<br>
    1) MLOps or ML Ops is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. ... When an algorithm is ready to be launched, MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems.<br>
  2)MLOps is a set of practices for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals. Applying these practices increases the quality, simplifies the management process, and automates the deployment of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in large-scale production environments. It’s easier to align models with business needs, as well as regulatory requirements.

The key phases of MLOps are:<br>

* Data gathering<br>
* Data analysis<br>
* Data transformation/preparation<br>
* Model training & development <br>
* Model validation <br>
* Model serving <br>
* Model monitoring <br>
* Model re-training.<br>

Basic Difference between MLOps and DevOps.

 ML there are a few notable differences:<br>

* Continuous Integration (CI) is no longer only about testing and validating code and components, but also testing and validating data, data schemas, and models.<br>
* Continuous Deployment (CD) is no longer about a single software package or service, but a system (an ML training pipeline) that should automatically deploy another service <br>(model prediction service) or roll back changes from a model.
* Continuous Testing (CT) is a new property, unique to ML systems, that’s concerned with automatically retraining and serving the models<br>


What is the use of MLOps?<br>
Answer:- MLOps accounts for the unique aspects of AI/ML projects in project management, CI/CD( continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.), and quality assurance, helping you improve delivery time, reduce defects, and make data science more productive. MLOps refers to a methodology that is built on applying DevOps practices to machine learning workloads.

What is MLOps technology?<br>
Answer:- Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a combination of processes, emerging best practices and underpinning technologies that provides a scalable, centralized and governed means to automate and scale the deployment and management of trusted ML applications in production environments.

What is MLOps and why do we need it?<br>
Answer:-Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) allows organizations to alleviate many of the issues on the path to AI with ROI by providing a technological backbone for managing the machine learning lifecycle through automation and scalability. ... AI and machine learning projects should be driving the future of your business.

What comes under MLOps?<br>
Answer:- Machine Learning systems can be categorized in eight different categories: data collection, data processing, feature engineering, data labelling, model design, model training and optimization, endpoint deployment, and endpoint monitoring.
